In this use case, we aim to analyze the historical and current supply/demand (S/D) ratio for products in an inventory system. The goal is to understand past risks and manage current inventory levels effectively. We utilize data from three key sources:

- **Stock Table**: Records the historical and current stock levels of products.
- **OrderSchedule Table**: Details the historical and upcoming orders, including quantities and dates.
- **SafetyStock Table**: Lists the safety stock levels required for each product to ensure smooth operations.

# Tables:

## Stock Table

ProductID: Unique identifier for the product.

ProductName: Name of the product.

| OrderID | OrderDate  | CustomerID | ProductID | Quantity | Value | ShippingPoint |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 101     | 2024-07-01 | C001       | 2         | 30       | 300   | WH1           |

SafetyStock Table

ProductID: Unique identifier for the product (foreign key referencing Stock).

SafetyStock: Safety stock level for the product.

| ProductID | SafetyStock |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | 10          |
| 2         | 15          |
| 3         | 5           |
| 4         | 8           |
| 5         | 12          |


# Why Use FULL OUTER JOIN?
Using a FULL OUTER JOIN is essential for this analysis because it allows us to:

Capture Complete History: Include all products, regardless of whether they have stock entries, sales entries, or both in any given month. This comprehensive inclusion is crucial for historical analysis.

Identify Risks: Capture scenarios where a product might have had stock but no sales in a specific month or sales but no stock. Identifying these gaps helps understand risks such as understocking or overstocking that occurred in the past.

Comprehensive View: By combining data from both stock and order schedules, we can accurately calculate the supply/demand ratio over time, determine the stock status (understocked, overstocked, or balanced), and track changes month by month. This historical perspective helps in identifying patterns and making informed decisions to mitigate future risks.

Without a FULL OUTER JOIN, we risk missing critical historical data points, leading to incomplete or inaccurate insights into past inventory risks and current management needs.
