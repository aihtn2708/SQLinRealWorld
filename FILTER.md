# WHERE - HAVING - ON
## WHERE Clause
Purpose: Used to filter rows before any grouping or aggregation occurs.
When to Use: When you need to filter records based on specified conditions before performing any aggregation (e.g., SUM, COUNT).
Scope: Applies to individual rows in the table.
> Eg: Let's find products that have a price greater than $300.
```sql
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > 300;
```
| ProductID | ProductName | Price |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1         | Laptop      | 1000  |
| 2         | Smartphone  | 700   |

## HAVING Clause
Purpose: Used to filter groups after aggregation.
When to Use: When you need to filter aggregated results (e.g., groups created by GROUP BY).
Scope: Applies to groups of rows created by GROUP BY.
> Eg: Let's find categories with a total quantity of stock movements greater than 100.
```sql
SELECT c.CategoryID, c.CategoryName, SUM(sm.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Categories c
JOIN Products p ON c.CategoryID = p.CategoryID
JOIN StockMovements sm ON p.ProductID = sm.ProductID
GROUP BY c.CategoryID, c.CategoryName
HAVING SUM(sm.Quantity) > 100;
```
| CategoryID | CategoryName | TotalQuantity |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1          | Electronics  | 160           |
| 2          | Accessories  | 150           |

### ON Clause
Purpose: Used to specify join conditions between tables.
When to Use: When you need to define how two tables should be joined.
Scope: Applies to rows being joined between tables.
> Eg: Let's list all products in category Electronics.
```sql
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, c.CategoryName
FROM Products p
JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID;
AND c.CategoryName = 'Electronics'
```
| ProductID | ProductName | CategoryID | CategoryName | Unit | Price | DateReceived |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|------|-------|--------------|
| 1         | Laptop      | 1          | Electronics  | pcs  | 1000  | 2023-01-10   |
| 2         | Smartphone  | 1          | Electronics  | pcs  | 700   | 2023-01-15   |
| 4         | Monitor     | 1          | Electronics  | pcs  | 300   | 2023-02-01   |

# USE CASE
Below is the use case of inventory management with examples of different types of filtering WHERE, HAVING, ON.
## 1. Finding Products with Low Stock
Identify products with current stock below a certain threshold (e.g., 50 units).
>Uses a HAVING clause to filter products with a calculated current stock below 50 units.
```sql
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN sm.MovementType = 'IN' THEN sm.Quantity ELSE -sm.Quantity END) AS CurrentStock
FROM Products p
JOIN StockMovements sm ON p.ProductID = sm.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
HAVING CurrentStock < 50;
```

## 2. Checking Stock Levels by Category
Get the total stock for each product category.
>Aggregates total stock for each product category using a GROUP BY clause.
```sql
SELECT c.CategoryID, c.CategoryName, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN sm.MovementType = 'IN' THEN sm.Quantity ELSE -sm.Quantity END) AS TotalStock
FROM Categories c
JOIN Products p ON c.CategoryID = p.CategoryID
JOIN StockMovements sm ON p.ProductID = sm.ProductID
GROUP BY c.CategoryID, c.CategoryName;
```

## 3. Identifying Fast-Moving Products
Find products with the highest quantity sold in the last 30 days.
>Filters and orders products by total quantity sold in the last 30 days.
```sql
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN sm.MovementType = 'OUT' THEN sm.Quantity ELSE 0 END) AS TotalSold
FROM Products p
JOIN StockMovements sm ON p.ProductID = sm.ProductID
WHERE sm.MovementDate >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

# 4. Analyzing Stock Aging
Identify products that have been in stock for more than 180 days and their remaining quantities.
>Identifies products in stock for more than 180 days, ensuring they have a positive stock.
```sql
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.DateReceived, 
       DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), p.DateReceived) AS DaysInStock,
       SUM(CASE WHEN sm.MovementType = 'IN' THEN sm.Quantity ELSE -sm.Quantity END) AS CurrentStock
FROM Products p
JOIN StockMovements sm ON p.ProductID = sm.ProductID
WHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), p.DateReceived) > 180
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.DateReceived
HAVING CurrentStock > 0;
```

## 5. Monitoring Restocking Needs
Identify products that need to be restocked based on minimum stock levels.
>Filters products that need to be restocked based on a minimum stock level threshold.
```sql
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN sm.MovementType = 'IN' THEN sm.Quantity ELSE -sm.Quantity END) AS CurrentStock
FROM Products p
JOIN StockMovements sm ON p.ProductID = sm.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
HAVING CurrentStock < 100; -- Assume 100 units as the minimum stock level
```
