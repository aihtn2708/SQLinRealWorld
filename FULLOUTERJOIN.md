An full outer join is a method of combining tables so that the result includes unmatched rows of both tables. If you are joining two tables and want the result set to include unmatched rows from both tables, use a FULL OUTER JOIN clause. The matching is based on the join condition.

In this use case, we aim to analyze the historical and current supply/demand (S/D) ratio for products in an inventory system. The goal is to understand past risks and manage current inventory levels effectively. We utilize data from three key sources:

- **Stock Table**: Records the historical and current stock levels of products.
- **OrderSchedule Table**: Details the historical and upcoming orders, including quantities and dates.
- **SafetyStock Table**: Lists the safety stock levels required for each product to ensure smooth operations.

# Tables:

## Stock Table

- ProductID: Unique identifier for the product.

- ProductName: Name of the product.

- StockQuantity: Quantity of the product in stock.

- StockDate: Date of the stock entry.


| ProductID | ProductName | StockQuantity | StockDate  |

# Why Use FULL OUTER JOIN?

Using a FULL OUTER JOIN is essential for this analysis because it allows us to:

- **Capture Complete History**: Include all products, regardless of whether they have stock entries, sales entries, or both in any given month. This comprehensive inclusion is crucial for historical analysis.

- **Identify Risks**: Capture scenarios where a product might have had stock but no sales in a specific month or sales but no stock. Identifying these gaps helps understand risks such as understocking or overstocking that occurred in the past.

- **Comprehensive View**: By combining data from both stock and order schedules, we can accurately calculate the supply/demand ratio over time, determine the stock status (understocked, overstocked, or balanced), and track changes month by month. This historical perspective helps in identifying patterns and making informed decisions to mitigate future risks.

**Without a FULL OUTER JOIN**, we risk missing critical historical data points, leading to incomplete or inaccurate insights into past inventory risks and current management needs.

# Example: Impact of Not Using FULL OUTER JOIN
To illustrate the impact of not using a FULL OUTER JOIN, let's consider alternative joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN. We'll use the same tables (Stock, OrderSchedule, and SafetyStock) but with different join strategies to see what data might be missing.

## Using INNER JOIN
An INNER JOIN only includes records that have matching entries in both tables.
```sql
SELECT 
    s.ProductID,
    s.ProductName,
    s.StockDate,
    s.StockQuantity,
    o.OrderID,
    o.OrderDate,
    o.Quantity AS OrderQuantity,
    ss.SafetyStock
FROM 
    Stock s
INNER JOIN 
    OrderSchedule o ON s.ProductID = o.ProductID
INNER JOIN 
    SafetyStock ss ON s.ProductID = ss.ProductID;
```
<!-- Results using INNER JOIN -->
| ProductID | ProductName | StockDate  | StockQuantity | OrderID | OrderDate  | OrderQuantity | SafetyStock |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 2         | Widget B    | 2024-07-01 | 20            | 101     | 2024-07-01 | 30            | 15          |
| 2         | Widget B    | 2024-08-01 | 30            | 103     | 2024-08-04 | 15            | 15          |
| 3         | Widget C    | 2024-07-01 | 0             | 102     | 2024-07-03 | 25            | 5           |
| 3         | Widget C    | 2024-08-01 | 10            | 104     | 2024-08-05 | 20            | 5           |


**Impact:** Products like Widget A and Widget D that have no corresponding sales entries in the OrderSchedule table are excluded. This incomplete data can lead to inaccurate insights, ignoring important inventory statuses.

## Using LEFT JOIN
A LEFT JOIN includes all records from the left table (Stock) and matched records from the right table (OrderSchedule).

```sql
SELECT 
    s.ProductID,
    s.ProductName,
    s.StockDate,
    s.StockQuantity,
    o.OrderID,
    o.OrderDate,
    o.Quantity AS OrderQuantity,
    ss.SafetyStock
FROM 
    Stock s
LEFT JOIN 
    OrderSchedule o ON s.ProductID = o.ProductID
LEFT JOIN 
    SafetyStock ss ON s.ProductID = ss.ProductID;
```
<!-- Results using LEFT JOIN -->
| ProductID | ProductName | StockDate  | StockQuantity | OrderID | OrderDate  | OrderQuantity | SafetyStock |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1         | Widget A    | 2024-07-01 | 50            | NULL    | NULL       | NULL          | 10          |
| 1         | Widget A    | 2024-08-01 | 40            | NULL    | NULL       | NULL          | 10          |
| 2         | Widget B    | 2024-07-01 | 20            | 101     | 2024-07-01 | 30            | 15          |
| 2         | Widget B    | 2024-08-01 | 30            | 103     | 2024-08-04 | 15            | 15          |
| 3         | Widget C    | 2024-07-01 | 0             | 102     | 2024-07-03 | 25            | 5           |
| 3         | Widget C    | 2024-08-01 | 10            | 104     | 2024-08-05 | 20            | 5           |
| 4         | Widget D    | 2024-07-01 | 15            | NULL    | NULL       | NULL          | 8           |
| 4         | Widget D    | 2024-08-01 | 25            | NULL    | NULL       | NULL          | 8           |


**Impact:** Products without corresponding sales are included, but we still miss products like Widget E that have sales but no stock data, leading to incomplete analysis.

## Using RIGHT JOIN
A RIGHT JOIN includes all records from the right table (OrderSchedule) and matched records from the left table (Stock).

```sql
SELECT 
    s.ProductID,
    s.ProductName,
    s.StockDate,
    s.StockQuantity,
    o.OrderID,
    o.OrderDate,
    o.Quantity AS OrderQuantity,
    ss.SafetyStock
FROM 
    Stock s
RIGHT JOIN 
    OrderSchedule o ON s.ProductID = o.ProductID
RIGHT JOIN 
    SafetyStock ss ON s.ProductID = ss.ProductID;
```
<!-- Results using RIGHT JOIN -->
| ProductID | ProductName | StockDate  | StockQuantity | OrderID | OrderDate  | OrderQuantity | SafetyStock |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 2         | Widget B    | 2024-07-01 | 20            | 101     | 2024-07-01 | 30            | 15          |
| 2         | Widget B    | 2024-08-01 | 30            | 103     | 2024-08-04 | 15            | 15          |
| 3         | Widget C    | 2024-07-01 | 0             | 102     | 2024-07-03 | 25            | 5           |
| 3         | Widget C    | 2024-08-01 | 10            | 104     | 2024-08-05 | 20            | 5           |
| 5         | NULL        | NULL       | NULL          | 105     | 2024-08-10 | 12            | 12          |

**Impact: **Products like Widget A and Widget D that have stock but no sales are excluded. Additionally, without proper handling of the safety stock join, some products might show up without necessary details.
